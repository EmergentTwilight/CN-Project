Although our algorithm constructs a hierarchy on subsets of vertices, it still breaks the lower bound for ``hierarchy-based'' algorithms in~\cite{PR05}. This is because our algorithm does not satisfy the ``hierarchy property'' (Property 6.1 in~\cite{PR05}), which mainly comes from \textsc{FindPivots} procedure which deals with shortest paths of a small number of edges. In the counterexample of Theorem 6.1 in~\cite{PR05}, \textsc{FindPivots} procedure can find all the distances without sorting them.
