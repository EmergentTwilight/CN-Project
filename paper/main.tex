\begin{abstract}
    We give a deterministic $O(m\log^{2/3}n)$-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in the comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the $O(m+n\log n)$ time bound of Dijkstra's algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra's algorithm is not optimal for SSSP. 
    %Previously there is an algorithm with running time $O(m+n\log\log\min\{n,C\})$ for directed integer weighted graphs in the RAM model, where $C$ is the maximal edge weight [Thorup 2004]. Recently the optimality of Dijkstra algorithm (with a new type of heap) for \emph{ordering vertices by distances from the source} is proved [Haeupler, Hlad\'{\i}k, Rozho\v{n}, Tarjan, T\v{e}tek 2024]. However, our algorithm does not fully sort all the vertices by distances, making it possible to break the $\Theta(n\log n)$ sorting barrier.\xiao{I would not put the discussion of HHRTT24 in the abstract.}
