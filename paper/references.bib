His algorithm works by traversing a so-called component tree. Two new related results are provided here. First, and most importantly, Thorup's approach is generalized from undirected to directed networks. The resulting time bound, O(n + m log w), is the best deterministic linear-space bound known for sparse networks unless w is superpolynomial in log n. As an application, all-pairs shortest-paths problems in directed networks with n vertices, m edges, and edge weights in -2w,..., 2w can be solved in O(nm + n2 log log n) time and O(n + m) space (not counting the output space). Second, it is shown that the component tree for an undirected network can be constructed in deterministic linear time and space with a simple algorithm, to be contrasted with a complicated and impractical solution suggested by Thorup. Another contribution of the present paper is a greatly simplified view of the principles underlying algorithms based on component trees.",

    abstract = { Priority queues are some of the most fundamental data structures. For example, they are used directly for task scheduling in operating systems. Moreover, they are essential to greedy algorithms. We study the complexity of integer priority queue operations on a RAM with arbitrary word size, modeling the possibilities in standard imperative programming languages such as C. We present exponential improvements over previous bounds, and we show tight relations to sorting.Our first result is a RAM priority queue supporting find-min in constant time and insert and delete-min in time O(log log n), where n is the current number of keys in the queue. This is an exponential improvement over the \$O(\sqrt{\log n})\$ bound of Fredman and Willard [ Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, Baltimore, MD, pp. 1--7]. Plugging this priority queue into Dijkstra's algorithm gives an O(mlog log m) algorithm for the single source shortest path problem on a graph with m edges, as compared with the previous \$O(m\sqrt{\log m})\$ bound based on Fredman and Willard's priority queue. The above bounds assume \$O(n 2^{{\varepsilon} w})\$ space, where w is the word length and \${\varepsilon}>0\$. They can, however, be achieved in linear space using randomized hashing.Our second result is a general equivalence between sorting and priority queues. A priority queue is monotone if the minimum is nondecreasing over time, as in many greedy algorithms. We show that on a RAM, the amortized operation cost of a monotone priority queue is equivalent to the per-key cost of sorting. For example, the equivalence implies that the single source shortest paths problem on a graph with m edges is no harder than that of sorting m keys. With the current RAM sorting, this gives an O(m log log m) time bound, as above, but the relation holds regardless of the future developments in RAM sorting.From the equivalence result, for any fixed \${\varepsilon}>0\$, we derive a randomized monotone \$O(\sqrt{\log n}^{1+{\varepsilon}})\$ priority queue with expected constant time decrease-key. Plugging this into Dijkstra's algorithm gives an \$O(n\sqrt{\log n}^{1+{\varepsilon}}+m)\$ algorithm for the single source shortest path problem on a graph with n nodes and m edges, complementing the above O(mlog log m) algorithm if \$m\gg n\$. This improves the O(nlog n/log log n + m) bound by Fredman and Willard [Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, St. Louis, MO, 1990, pp. 719--725], based on their O(log n/log log n) priority queue with constant decrease-key. }

This improves the O(n(log log n)2) time bound given in M. Thorup (1998) in “Proc. 1998 ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms (SODA'98),” pp. 550–555). This result is obtained by combining our new technique with that of Thorup's. Signature sorting (A. Andersson, T. Hagerup, S. Nilsson, and R. Raman, 1995, in “Proc. 1995 Symposium on Theory of Computing,” pp. 427–436), A. Andersson's result (1996, in “Proc. 1996 IEEE Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science,” pp. 135–141), R.

Shen, 1999, in “Proc. 1999 Tenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA'99),” Baltimore, MD, January, pp. 419–428) are also used for the design of our algorithms. We provide an approach and techniques which are totally different from previous approaches and techniques for the problem. As a consequence our technique can be extended to apply to nonconservative sorting and parallel sorting. Our nonconservative sorting algorithm sorts n integers in {0, 1, …, m−1} in time O(n(log log n)2/(log k+log log log n)) using word length k log(m+n), where k≤log n. Our EREW parallel algorithm sorts n integers in {0, 1, …, m−1} in O((log n)2) time and O(n(log log n)2/log log log n) operations provided log m=Ω((log n)2).}

Thus, any implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm sorts the vertices according to their distances from s. However, we do not know how to sort in linear time.Here, a deterministic linear time and linear space algorithm is presented for the undirected single source shortest paths problem with positive integer weights.

We present a deterministic linear space solution that with n integer keys supports delete in O(loglogn) time. If the integers are in the range [0,N), we can also support delete in O(loglogN) time. Even for the special case of monotone priority queues, where the minimum has to be non-decreasing, the best previous bounds on delete were O((logn)1/(3−ε)) and O((logN)1/(4−ε)). These previous bounds used both randomization and amortization. Our new bounds are deterministic, worst-case, with no restriction to monotonicity, and exponentially faster. As a classical application, for a directed graph with n nodes and m edges with non-negative integer weights, we get single source shortest paths in O(m+nloglogn) time, or O(m+nloglogC) if C is the maximal edge weight. The latter solves an open problem of Ahuja, Mehlhorn, Orlin, and Tarjan from 1990.}
